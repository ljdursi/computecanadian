Turning Principles into Operations 
==================================

Implementing governance best practices in our federation can greatly
improve how our federation functions, but we must make sure that the
federation operates in a way that lives up to the principles we choose
for our organization.

We must ensure that the metrics we set ourselves to measure success are
measuring the right things, rather than being easy to count. This is
genuinely difficult; it is easier to measure interactions with
researchers than the number of interactions that no longer have to take
place because a task has been made simpler. However, we must ensure that
our stated goals and our measurements of success coincide.

Services 
--------

In the document we argue the best model for our federated organization
is services based. All partners in the federation provide services to
each other to build the national platform, and collectively to the
researchers. The Central Office is accountable to the researchers
(through the Members) and so the Central Office is responsible for
ensuring the Regions are accountable for meeting their agreed upon
services.

We propose that the priorities for the national platform will be set
through collaboration with the regions and the central office. These
priorities will be defined by a service or more appropriately a set of
services with the associated Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and
interfaces. The SLAs must have clearly defined metrics for evaluating
the effectiveness of the services provided.

A federation colleague (ie: a region or the central office) will propose
taking on the responsibility for providing some or all of the necessary
service or services: allowing regions to build on existing strengths or
meet regional priorities. Ideally these services will be assigned based
on consensus, but for big ticket items where this is unlikely to be
possible by some pre-agreed upon process led by the central office.

Once the agreement is made, the provider is free to implement the
service in any way they see fit, but are held accountable for meeting
the agreed-upon standards and metrics.

Most services should normally go through a pilot phase before being
provided more widely. Deciding what success means for a pilot will
necessarily differ from service to service, and consensus should be
reached before the launching of a pilot what would merit a more
permanent, larger-scale roll-out.

It’s worth noting that it may be perfectly reasonable for some regions
or institutions to provide services locally that are not part of the
national platform; there are some services which are not possible to
provide nationally, or there might not be sufficient demand for outside
of a given region, but one jurisdiction may be willing to fund
nonetheless. Not every type of research support necessarily has to be
shoehorned into a national platform framework.

Relationship between Federation Partners 
----------------------------------------

While federations of equal partners must have a basis in consensus, each
partner has specific roles to play.

The central office must be the convenor of the “birds-eye view” of the
Canadian research community, working closely with national funding
agencies, national scholarly communities, and other research service
providers who can identify gaps in the research ecosystem, or
underserved communities. In that role, the central office should be
responsible for performing nation-wide needs assessments, measuring
researcher satisfaction, and ensuring the input of national researcher
communities into the federation’s discussions.

As a convener and facilitator, and as the organization developing
nation-wide assessments, the central office will always be the setter of
the federation’s agenda. It will need to be the body that drives the
push for evidence-based consensus around national priorities, planning
next steps, and where necessarily, building partnerships outside of the
federation to accomplish the federation’s agreed-upon goals.

Coherence of the national platform, and adherence to interoperability
and other agreed-upon standards, will necessarily be the responsibility
of the central office. It is this body that will perform monitoring of
these service levels, and testing interoperability. It is also the
central office’s responsibility to ensure that there are accountability
measures in place for service providers not meeting their SLAs. However,
since failure to provide interoperability or service levels is a failure
felt by the entire platform, not just the central office, other
federation partners must also play a role in enforcing these standards.

The needs assessment and SLA or interoperability monitoring roles are
vital, and generally will be the primary technical roles of the central
office, as researcher-facing technical services and operations will
generally be best managed by the regional organizations and sites.

Being nimble, and being able to quickly tell if a researcher-facing
service is successful or if it should be changed, will normally require
researcher-facing services to be provided organizationally close to the
researchers. This will generally mean that such services will be housed
in one or more regional organization.

On the other hand, internal services necessary for the administration
and operation of the federation itself — CRMs, email, dashboards and
monitoring, finance services — might reasonably be housed in any of a
number of places; any federation partner might propose hosting such a
service. As with a researcher-facing service, such a service would come
with an SLA. Externally-provided services would still require one
federation partner to be responsible for the SLA and interacting with
the vendor.

Relationship with Other Partners 
--------------------------------

As the uses of computation and data broaden, and become more integrated
into all areas of scholarship, investigators will increasingly need
services that require coordination of remote and institutional
computation and storage, networking, data management, and other research
services. It won’t — and shouldn’t — matter to those researchers this
coordination happens; either across multiple organizational boundaries
or within a single organization so long as the access to resources is
seamless.

Several models for how this close collaboration could work have been
proposed, and should be discussed by the community at large. As
suggested above, however, structures matter less in and of themselves
than they do for their effect on processes; and it is the process that
is crucial here. Just as it is unacceptable for researchers to have to
routinely cobble together resources to support their project within a
researcher-centred organization, it is unacceptable for researchers to
have to manage for themselves the more complex task of coordinating
resources across research support organizations.

In research, collaboration means much more than participants announcing
to each other what they have done or what they intend to do; just so
with research service organizations. A meaningful collaboration, one
that can make the best use of each other’s strengths and resources,
means frequent discussions through planning, implementation, and
execution phases of a project.
