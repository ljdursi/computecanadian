# Specific proposals

## Principles
**Proposal 1.1**: Research, and concrete researcher needs, should be the basis for all decision making.<br/>
**Proposal 1.2**: A broad range of research-support services should be offered, with new services continually piloted.<br/>
**Proposal 1.3**: The platform must be available to the entire Canadian research community, with specific efforts to efficiently assemble the most appropriate resources to support new and existing communities.<br/>
**Proposal 1.4**: The structure of our federation partnership must reflect the reality of several funding partners. <br/>
**Proposal 1.5**: The services offered by the national platform must be interoperable, not merely identical.<br/>
**Proposal 1.6**: The federation should aim to achieve more than the partners could achieve separately.<br/>
**Proposal 1.7**: New training should continually be available for emerging hardware and operational tools. <br/>
**Proposal 1.8**: The federation should make use of best available tools for interacting with, and supporting researchers.<br/>
## Governance Best Practices from Other Federations
**Proposal 2.1**: The federation partners, members, and funders must come to agreement on clearly-delineated roles and responsibilities of the central office and regional organizations.<br/>
**Proposal 2.2**: The central office Board should be provided the training and the support necessary to play their role in the federation. <br/>
**Proposal 2.3**: The central office and regional Boards should regularly meet to ensure alignment of governance. <br/>
**Proposal 2.4**: Members should be given the access and support they need to play an active role in the federation. <br/>
**Proposal 2.5**: Federation-wide decision making processes should be supported by all members of the federation.<br/>
**Proposal 2.6**: The federation should make it clear internally, to the research community, and to funders, the value of the federation, the delineation of roles, and the services provided by the federation.<br/>
## Turning Principles into Operations
**Proposal 3.1**: Services provided should come with agreed-upon SLAs ensuring quality and interoperability. <br/>
**Proposal 3.2**: Services should be piloted, with definitions of success decided upon before the pilot. <br/>
**Proposal 3.3**: The central office should be responsible for nation-wide needs assessments and researcher satisfaction. <br/>
**Proposal 3.4**: The agenda should be managed by the central office, and consensus should be found or built around priorities. <br/>
**Proposal 3.5**: The central office should be responsible for the monitoring and enforcing interoperability and other SLAs on the platform.<br/>
**Proposal 3.6**: Responsibility for implementation and operations of researcher-facing services should generally belong to the regional organizations or an external partner.<br/>
**Proposal 3.7**: The federation must work closely with other digital infrastructure providers and research services organizations in service design, service delivery, and future planning.<br/>
**Proposal 3.8**: Each federation colleague must advocate on behalf of the federation as a whole and the federation's researcher users to their funding partners and other external partners.<br/>
**Proposal 3.9**: A renewed federation should renew its relationship with the researcher community, emphasizing transparency, engagement, and accountability.<br/>
