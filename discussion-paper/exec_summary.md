Executive Summary{#background .unnumbered}
==========

As computing and data becomes more vital to research and scholarship in
every field, our Canadian research community deserves to have access to
a functioning, cooperating, national portfolio of computational
expertise and resources.

The current effort is not working; we need to start again, this time
designing the structure of our federated effort to match our goals.
Those goals must be chosen by the community as a whole, and this
document does not claim to be the only or best answer. Here is proposed
one set of principles such an effort must be guided by, details of how
the current attempt has failed those principles, and suggestions as to a
structure which lives up to the principles and goals we set ourselves.
But it is the discussion in the community and the consensus which forms
which will determine the final guiding principles and organizing
structure of a new national effort.

Here we work from the starting point that Canadian investigators would
be best served by a computational research support platform that is
researcher-focussed, service oriented, modern, truly national,
interoperable, and built by equal federal partners.

From that vantage point, an outline for a new approach starts to become
clearer.

Researcher Focus

:   The primary purpose of our organization is supporting Canadian
    research, and so researcher needs must always be the driver for
    decision making. We cannot continue to make expensive national-scale
    technical architecture decisions that have little connection to the
    needs of most of the research community, as with the WOS
    procurement.

Research Partners

:   We propose a service oriented approach to meet the needs of our
    researchers; rather than limiting ourselves to be hewers of FLOPS
    and drawers of bytes, we aim to provide a range of involvement and
    services, as has been successful in the UK and the US. By moving to
    a service oriented model and working more closely with the
    researchers, we will be better attuned to current and future needs;
    it will also simplify piloting new services, ensuring their
    usefulness and cost-effectiveness before deploying nationally.

A New Federalism

:   Over time, the national Compute Canada project has gone from being a
    loose association of occasionally-cooperating independent sites to a
    highly centralized expensive central office making extremely
    specific technical and personnel prescriptions for the entire
    country. Neither approach is sustainable; neither provides the best
    results for Canadian research.

    We propose a national office which sets an agenda based on
    demonstrated national research needs, but where decisions are made
    by consensus.

    We propose an approach based on interoperability, rather than
    uniformity, with clear interfaces defining the roles and
    responsibilities of the constituent parts to the national platform,
    and the flexibility to innovate in meeting those responsibilities.
